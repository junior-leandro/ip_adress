# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./src/assets/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). 


The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I'm using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I'm using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

# Overview

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

# My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- TypeScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) To get the IP Address locations
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) - To generate the map

### What I Learned

In this project, so far, I have developed the use of Tailwind CSS using the mobile-first workflow as suggested in the documentation, and the insertion of the map using the Leaflet library, and "dynamic" for dynamic rendering so as not to disturb the page loading . The next step will be the inclusion of the IPify API to obtain user data

**It Was Fun to Build!** ðŸš€
